    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        <span class="highlight">Z Viper</span> is not just a name, but a symbol whispered across the Dark Web.
        Known as a master of high-risk cyber operations, he built an underground empire that operated beyond
        borders, laws, and identities. With hundreds of operatives and control over multiple hidden networks,
        his presence shaped the digital underworld for years.

    <h2>Chronicle</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>December 10, 2023</strong> the legend of Z Viper reached a dramatic turning point. Known as one of the most feared and notorious figures in the digital underworld, he had built an empire that spanned hundreds of operatives, multiple hidden networks, and countless illicit operations. Through years of high-level cybercrime, Z Viper amassed a fortune worth millions of dollars. Yet, in a move that stunned both law enforcement and the dark web itself, he chose not to keep a single dollar for himself. The wealth he had so carefully accumulated existed only briefly in his hands, as if he had never intended to claim it at all.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>February 9, 2024</strong> the digital underworld was shaken to its core. Z Viper made a decision that would leave an indelible mark on cyber history: he donated every cent of his amassed fortune. Overnight, the millions he had earned vanished from existence, redirected to causes and people no one could trace. Speculation ran wild across encrypted forums and hidden chat rooms—some believed it was an act of pure altruism, others whispered about secret agendas or tests of loyalty. Regardless of the reason, the audacity and scale of this gesture left the world in disbelief, questioning the true motives behind such an unprecedented act of generosity.
        </li>

            <strong>March 2, 2024</strong> became the day of disappearance. Z Viper severed all connections,
            dismantled his influence, and erased his digital footprint. His final message echoed across
            encrypted boards:

    <div class="quote">
        “I sé quoi أنا करता हूँ”
        <br><br>
        <small>— “I know what I am doing.”</small>
    </div>

    <div class="mystery">
        No one truly knows why he did all of this.<br>
        Was it a game? A belief? Or a purpose far beyond money and power?<br><br>
        And when Z Viper disappeared, Mahin shot GOC. Nobody knows why it happened, and no one knows who GOC or Mahin really are.<br><br>
        Z Viper disappeared — but the questions never did.
